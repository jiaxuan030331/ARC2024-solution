# ARC Solver Examples

This document provides detailed examples of how our ARC solver handles different types of reasoning tasks.

## üí° Example 1: Object Removal & Background Reconstruction

![Object Removal Task](images/object_removal_task.png)

### Problem Description
Remove black shapes (letters/numbers) from colorful pixelated backgrounds and intelligently reconstruct the underlying patterns.

**Input**: Colorful background with black shape overlay  
**Output**: Clean background with black shapes removed and holes naturally filled

### Solution Approach: DAGSolver

The DAGSolver is ideal for this multi-step transformation task requiring intelligent pattern reconstruction.

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identifies black pixels (color 0) as removal targets
   - Analyzes surrounding color patterns for reconstruction clues

2. **Background Analysis** 
   - Learns the underlying pattern structure
   - Extracts color relationships and spatial patterns

3. **Transform Sequence**
   ```python
   transforms = [
       "filterCol_0",      # Remove black pixels ‚Üí create holes
       "extractPattern",   # Learn background pattern from surroundings
       "fillHoles",        # Intelligently fill empty regions
       "replicate"         # Ensure pattern continuity
   ]
   ```

4. **Candidate Generation**
   - Generates multiple solution candidates
   - Ranks by confidence and pattern consistency

#### Code Implementation:
```python
from arc_solver.solvers import create_balanced_dag_solver

# Initialize DAG solver with balanced configuration
dag_solver = create_balanced_dag_solver(enable_logging=True)

# Check if solver can handle this task type
if dag_solver.can_solve(task):
    results = dag_solver.solve(task)
    print(f"Generated {len(results)} solution candidates")
    
    # Results ranked by confidence score
    best_solution = results[0] if results else None
```

## üîç Example 2: Pattern Tiling & Expansion

![Tiling Pattern Task](images/tiling_pattern_task.png)

### Problem Description
Expand a small 2√ó2 color pattern into a larger 6√ó6 grid through systematic pattern tiling.

**Input**: 2√ó2 pattern `[[blue, magenta], [magenta, yellow]]`  
**Output**: 6√ó6 grid with 2√ó2 pattern repeated 3√ó3 times

### Solution Approach: TilingSolver

The TilingSolver specializes in detecting and applying systematic pattern repetitions.

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Size Ratio Detection**
   - Analyzes input (2√ó2) and expected output (6√ó6) 
   - Determines 3√ó expansion factor in both dimensions

2. **Pattern Extraction**
   - Identifies the fundamental 2√ó2 tile structure
   - Validates pattern consistency across training examples

3. **Tiling Application**
   ```python
   # Core tiling logic
   output = np.tile(input_pattern, (3, 3))  # Repeat 3√ó3 times
   ```

4. **Validation & Optimization**
   - Verifies tiling accuracy against training examples
   - Applies additional transforms if needed (rotation, reflection)

#### Code Implementation:
```python
from arc_solver.solvers import TilingSolver

# Initialize tiling solver
tiling_solver = TilingSolver()

# Check if task involves tiling patterns
if tiling_solver.can_solve(task):
    results = tiling_solver.solve(task)
    
    # TilingSolver typically returns high-confidence single solution
    if results:
        print("Successfully detected and applied tiling pattern")
        tiled_output = results[0]
```

## üéØ Solver Selection Strategy

### When to Use Each Solver

| Task Characteristics | Recommended Solver | Key Capabilities |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Complex multi-step transformations** | DAGSolver | Transform chaining, hole filling, pattern reconstruction |
| **Systematic pattern repetition** | TilingSolver | Size ratio detection, tile-based expansion |
| **Reflection/rotation patterns** | SymmetrySolver | Symmetry detection and repair |
| **Checkerboard/periodic grids** | ChessSolver | Chess pattern recognition and generation |
| **Feature-based classification** | MLSolver | Decision tree learning, statistical features |

### Automatic Solver Selection

Our framework automatically tries solvers in order of likelihood:

```python
from arc_solver import ArcSolver

solver = ArcSolver()
result = solver.solve(task)  # Automatically selects best solver

# Manual solver selection if needed
if dag_solver.can_solve(task):
    return dag_solver.solve(task)
elif tiling_solver.can_solve(task):
    return tiling_solver.solve(task)
elif symmetry_solver.can_solve(task):
    return symmetry_solver.solve(task)
# ... additional fallback chain
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration

```python
from arc_solver.solvers import create_accurate_dag_solver, TilingSolver
from arc_solver.core.config import SolverConfig

# High-accuracy DAG solver for complex tasks
dag_solver = create_accurate_dag_solver(
    max_depth=25,
    complexity_penalty=0.005
)

# Custom tiling solver with specific parameters
tiling_solver = TilingSolver(
    min_pattern_size=(2, 2),
    max_pattern_size=(5, 5)
)
```

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Enable C++ optimizations for speed
config = SolverConfig(
    enable_cpp=True,
    max_candidates=3,
    timeout=30
)

solver = ArcSolver(config=config)
```

### Error Handling

```python
try:
    results = solver.solve(task)
    if not results:
        print("No solution found")
    else:
        print(f"Found {len(results)} candidate solutions")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Solver error: {e}")
    # Framework automatically falls back to Python implementations
```
